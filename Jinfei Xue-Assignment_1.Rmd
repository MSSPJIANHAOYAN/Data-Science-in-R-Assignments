## Document assignment

Consider the following situation:
A sloppy printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. You want to know how many pages have more than k misprints in a book of n pages. Make an n x k table that shows the relationship between the total number of pages in a book and the number of pages with k misprints.

Show and explain your work. Include equations and calculations to teach the reader how to solve the problem. Include an image of a book.

Push your solution to a github repository and submit the url for repository on blackboard. Be sure your repo includes your document as a pdf file and as an RMD file. Include other files needed to recompile your document.

## 1 Calculate $p_k$

In this situation, the misprints in a page are distributed in Poisson Distribution. 

Given the stated mean value of 2 misprints per page, assume the distribution of $M$, the number of misprints on a page, is $Poisson(\lambda = 2)$

Therefore, conditioned on $k$, a limit to be determined, the probability $p_k$ of more than $k$ misprints on a page is:  

$p_k = P(M > k) = 1 - P(M \leq k) =$ 1 - ppois($k$, lambda = 2). 

## 2 Calculate $P(T \leq n | k)$

Probability of $T$ no more than $n$ pages with more than $k$ misprints is:  

$P(T \leq n) =$ pbinom($n$, 50, $p_k$).  

## 3 Make an n x k table

Take n=50, k=10 for example.

### A table of $p_k = P(M > k)$

```{r}
prob<-1 - ppois(0:10,lambda = 2)
prob <- as.data.frame(prob)
k <- 0:10
prob <- cbind(k, prob)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
p.tab <- kable(prob)
kable_styling(p.tab, bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

### A table of n x k

the input in the table represent the value of $P(T \leq n | K=k)$. The row represents the number of pages whose misprints are more than $k$.

```{r}
prob<- as.vector(prob[,2])
col_k<-vector(mode = "numeric",length = 0)
result<-rep(NULL,51)
for(i in 1:11){
  for(j in 1:51){
    b<-prob[i]
    col_k[j]<-pbinom(j-1, size = 50, b)
  }
  result<-cbind(result,col_k)
}
table<-as.data.frame(result)
rownames(table)=paste(0:50,"pages",sep="")
colnames(table)=0:10
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
nk.tab <- kable(table)
kable_styling(nk.tab, bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE, position = "left", font_size = 7)

```


## Book Picture

```{r}
download.file(url = "http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/12437/cover/9780521112437.jpg",
          destfile = "book.jpg",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "book.jpg")
```
